1.
A server port is like a mailbox number on a computer, 
helping identify which specific task or program should receive incoming data or messages in a network.

2.
The number of bits needed to represent server ports is determined by doubling (2^n), where n is the number of bits. In this case,
it's 2^16 because there are 16 bits to represent port numbers from 0 to 65535
